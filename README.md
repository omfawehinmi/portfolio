Welcome to my portfolio repository!

This repository serves as a showcase for my resume projects and personal work as a data scientist/data engineer. Here, you will find a collection of projects that highlight my technical abilities, problem-solving skills, and passion for data analysis.

Throughout this repository, you will find a diverse range of projects that I have worked on, covering various domains and utilizing different techniques. These projects demonstrate my proficiency in data manipulation, exploratory data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization.

Each project is organized within its respective directory, containing all the necessary code, documentation, and relevant datasets. I have made an effort to provide clear and concise explanations, ensuring that anyone exploring the projects can understand the objectives, methodologies, and outcomes.

Feel free to browse through the projects and delve into the code to get a better understanding of my technical skills and coding practices. I have also included a README file for each project, which provides additional context, insights, and instructions for running the code or reproducing the analysis.

I am continuously updating and adding new projects to this repository as I expand my knowledge and tackle new challenges. I believe in the power of data to drive informed decision-making, and I am excited to contribute my skills to impactful projects in the data science and engineering field.
