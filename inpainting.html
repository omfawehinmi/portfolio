        <p>This project focuses on detecting image inpainting using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and an ensemble model. The project takes advantage of a dual dataset approach, combining the CIFAKE dataset, enriched with real and AI-generated synthetic images, alongside the esteemed DeepFake Detection Challenge Dataset. Training the CNNs entails an intricate amalgamation of techniques, including the strategic application of transfer learning, which capitalizes on pre-trained models' intrinsic feature extraction capabilities. The arsenal of strategies further expands with the integration of data augmentation to enhance generalization, early stopping for combating overfitting, and regularization to ensure optimum model robustness. The models' convergence is expedited through the application of the binary cross-entropy loss function, while the judicious freezing of layers refines efficiency. The project's apex lies in the formulation of an ensemble model, intelligently combining the diverse predictions from individual CNNs. Hyperparameter optimization through the sophisticated hyperopt library underscores the meticulous nature of parameter tuning. As a harmonious culmination of these technical methodologies, the project unveils an impeccable demonstration of CNNs' prowess and ensemble methods' finesse in effectively detecting inpainted regions. In doing so, it exemplifies their transformative potential within the domain of image forensics and the ever-evolving field of manipulation detection.</p>
