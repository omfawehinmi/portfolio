                        <h2 class="home__subtitle">Introduction</h2>
                        <p class="home__description">In a world inundated with digital media and misinformation, ensuring image 
                            authenticity is paramount. This paper introduces an innovative inpainting image 
                            detection tool, using machine learning to verify the presence of inpainting in images. 
                            Inpainting, the process of filling in missing parts of an image, is often used for manipulation. 
                            The tool analyzes images, detecting irregularities that may indicate inpainting and 
                            providing a confidence score. Its purpose is to combat the spread of fake media and 
                            misinformation, safeguarding users from deceptive visuals. Journalists, fact-checkers, 
                            art experts, e-commerce platforms, and social media networks can benefit from the tool 
                            to validate image authenticity and uphold credibility. By providing a reliable defense 
                            against manipulated visuals, the tool ensures trust in the integrity of digital media.</p>

                            the CIFAKE dataset, enriched with real and AI-generated synthetic images, alongside the esteemed DeepFake 
                            Detection Challenge Dataset. Training the CNNs entails an intricate amalgamation of techniques, including 
                            the strategic application of transfer learning, which capitalizes on pre-trained models' intrinsic feature

                            model robustness. The models' convergence is expedited through the application of the binary cross-entropy 
                            loss function, while the judicious freezing of layers refines efficiency. The project's apex lies in the

                        <p class="home__description">he model is implemented using transfer learning and a pre-trained convolutional neural 
                            network (CNN) architecture called DenseNet121. Transfer learning allows leveraging the knowledge 
                            learned from a large dataset (ImageNet) to improve performance on the target task with a smaller 
                            dataset.The ImageDataGenerator class from TensorFlow is utilized to rescale the pixel values of 
                            the images to a range between 0 and 1, a common preprocessing step in image classification tasks. 
                            By utilizing this pre-trained model as a starting point, the model can benefit from the rich hierarchical 
                            features learned by DenseNet121 during its extensive training on ImageNet.</p><br>
                          <p>To build the model, the DenseNet121 model is loaded with its pre-trained weights from ImageNet. 
                            The pre-trained layers are frozen, preventing any updates during training to retain the valuable 
                            knowledge captured from the large-scale dataset. This crucial step ensures that the pre-trained 
                            weights remain fixed during the fine-tuning process, preserving the knowledge gained from ImageNet 
                            while allowing the model to adapt to the new classification task.Additional layers are stacked on top of the 
                            DenseNet121 to create a custom classifier tailored to the fake vs. real image classification 
                            task. These layers include Convolutional layers, which are responsible for learning specific 
                            features from the input images. By applying the ReLU activation function and using a 3x3 kernel, 
                            non-linearity is introduced to the model, enhancing its ability to capture complex patterns in 
                            the data. The final layers of the model consist of fully connected Dense layers. These layers allow the model 
                            to combine the learned features and make a binary classification decision. The output layer is 
                            configured with a single unit and a sigmoid activation function, generating a probability score 
                            representing the likelihood of the input image belonging to the positive class.The model is then compiled with the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss, which 
                            is well-suited for binary classification problems. We employ early stopping and learning rate 
                            reduction callbacks to prevent overfitting and improve training efficiency. These callbacks 
                            halt the training process if the loss does not improve over a certain number of epochs or 
                            reduce the learning rate if the loss plateaus.</p>
